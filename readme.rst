What is Dineout
###################

Dineout is a Web and Mobile Application for finding hotels and restaurants which are near to the user. The prime objective of ’DineOut ’is to create a full fledged application
which could locate a list of restaurants based on location and various factors like budget,food type etc.The user not only finds the nearest restaurants but also he can make a choice of best restaurant based on rating.Location-Based services or LBS are made use while implementing this application.This includes location obtained from the Global Positioning System(GPS).A detailed analytic report is provided to restaurant management depending on the user feedbacks.

Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.4 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.2.4 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
